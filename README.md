## Reporting Issues

Issues can be reported by using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/latera/homs/issues).

## Testing

homs uses RSpec for unit/spec tests. You need to set up different testing database. Otherwise your development DB would be erased.

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec spec

# Run a single test file
bundle exec rspec spec/PATH/TO/FILE_spec.rb

# Run a subset of tests
bundle exec rspec spec/PATH/TO/DIR
```
